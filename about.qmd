I am an incoming PhD student and computational political communications researcher at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information. I have 10 years' experience working in federal and municipal Canadian politics. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Ottawa where I hold an Honours Bachelor of Arts with a Double Major in Communication and Media Studies and History. As well, I previously worked as a Research Assistant at the [Pol Comm Tech Lab](https://www.polcommtech.com/) directed by Dr. Elizabeth Dubois at the University of Ottawa.

I am passionate about the historical and contemporary experiences of women in the public sphere and aim to increase the participation of women in politics through my work and research. My recently completed Master's thesis research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC CGS-M) and Government of Ontario (OGS) and examined the online harassment of Canadian female politicians, specifically when Tweeting about climate change and environmental policy

I enjoy publicly speaking about my experiences in Canadian politics, parliamentary affairs, and increasing the number of women elected to all levels of government. Please reach out if you would like me to present on my experiences, research, or to collaborate.
