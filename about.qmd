I am a MI Candidate, incoming PhD student, and computational political communications researcher at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information. I have 10 years' experience working in federal and municipal Canadian politics. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Ottawa where I hold an Honours Bachelor of Arts with a Double Major in Communication and Media Studies and History. As well, I previously worked as a Research Assistant at the [Pol Comm Tech Lab](https://www.polcommtech.com/) directed by Dr. Elizabeth Dubois at the University of Ottawa.

I am passionate about the historical and contemporary experiences of women in the public sphere and aims to increase the participation of women in politics through my work and research. My current Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC CGS-M) and Ontario Graduate Scholar (OGS) funded research studies the intersections of the harassment of Canadian female politicians and climate change discourse on Twitter.

I enjoy publicly speaking about my experiences in Canadian politics, parliamentary affairs, and increasing the number of women elected to all levels of government. Please reach out if you would like me to present on my experiences, research, or to collaborate.
