    "text": "I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information. I completed my Master of Information at the University of Toronto and received my Honours Bachelor of Arts with a Double Major in Communication and History from the University of Ottawa.\nMy Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) funded doctoral work develops computational and statistical methods to better measure and understand the nature and extent of online harassment faced by Canadian politicians. More broadly, my research focuses on the political uses of social media and artificial intelligence, gender and politics, and computational social science methods. My work has appeared in Social Media + Society, the Canadian Journal of Political Science, and The Conversation, among other venues. \nI have 11 years of experience working in federal Canadian politics. Additionally, I previously worked as a Research Assistant at the Pol Comm Tech Lab directed by Dr. Elizabeth Dubois at the University of Ottawa. I am passionate about getting more women involved in politics through my work and research. \nFor inquiries, please reach out: Inessa.DeAngelis@mail.utoronto.ca."
